<H2><Font color="white">Dark Souls III is an action role-playing video game developed by From Software. It was officially announced on June 15, 2015 at E3. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 24, 2016 in Japan, with a worldwide release scheduled for April 12 of the same year. A code was given to users who pre-ordered the game to play Dark Souls on Xbox One. Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, the player is tasked to survive an oncoming apocalypse brought about by the ongoing conflict between the age of fire and those branded with the Dark Sign as with previous iterations of the series. To survive this event the player character must face the Lords of Cinder, previous heroes who linked the fire, as the cycle of Light and Dark continues and no matter what you do, darkness will return and repeat itself forever.</Font></H2>

<h2><font color="white">The Parameter Bonus rating (Top Image), also known as Scaling, is a gameplay mechanic in Dark Souls. It indicates the level of bonus damage one can do with a weapon, based on the associated stats. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill).

Strength and Dexterity will increase the physical damage while Intelligence and Faith will increase the magic damage of weapons. Lightning and Fire weapons do not scale with any stat.

Chaos weapons will scale with Humanity. This will increase both its physical and fire damage. Each weapon has:

<P>Four base damage values: physical, magic, lightning, and fire. These are the numbers shown as the weapon's stats.
Five scaling values: strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith, and humanity.
The only weapons with humanity scaling are Chaos weapons, and their scaling is always 0.21.</P>

<p>Each character has:

Five ratings: strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith, and humanity. These are not equal to the stats in question, but are derived from them.
With these all in mind, the formulas are laid out below</p></font></h2>

<h2><font color="white">Final Product: What Could have been made</font></h2>
</hr>

<h2><font color="white">If you ever play darksouls 3 and you don't know which weapon is the better than the other this feature would have been the best tool for you! But the final product is a work in progress as it would require quite a bit of time The idea of the final product was to create a Weapon comparison mechanic using javascript. The final product would have been followed like this: </font></h2>

<img src="images/weapon.png" alt="use" style="width:880px;height:150px;">
<img src="images/weapon2.png" alt="use" style="width:880px;height:150px;">

<h2><font color="white">There would be a selection of weapons and you would select any weapon that is in the game of darksouls and it would give you its stats such as dex, strength, etc and highlight which is the best weapon. It's a very handy mechanic that would save time and trouble and it point out any characteristics. As shown above, the weapons would be shown like that and under the image it would display its stats and would recommned you which is best fit for your character. Give me a passing grade.</h2></font>
