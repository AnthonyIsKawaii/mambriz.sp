<h2><font color="#ffffff">Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge. You have to take the control of a legendary hero using the programming language of your choice. You will fight with other AI for a predetermined number of turns and the hero with the greatest amount of gold will win. In this game you aren't control of your bot it is all programmed and it basically controls itslef!  </font></h2>

<h2><font color="white">This is how the Ai is viewed on Vindinium.org and once it is running the bots then follow their program and the score and amount of gold is kept tracked. What's cool is that the game is always randomized so the taverns, mines, and map is in different locations. The spawns are always in the same spot but the character spawns are always different.</font></h2>

<h2><font color="white"> The first line of code is creating the bot and giving it a name. The second line of code called pathfinding means the plotting, by a computer application and finding the shortest route between two points. The third line of code means it is being directed to "vindinium.org" which will be allowed to be displayed on the site and be run. The third line of code is a node called bluebird which is a "promise" because it is easier to use and more effecient. Lines 14-29 is global data that follows the data is used on vindinium.org. The rest of the code is writing code that will be used to place it in its position. In line 24-28, it basically means that if my bot encounters another bot it will attack it and that's what it means that it will "push".   </font></h2>

<h2><font color="white"> The first line of code is talking about the bot searching for mines. The second line of code means that once my bot reaches a certain health my bot will begin to look for taverns to regain its health. The third else statement is giving the bot to attack other bots. Line 54-62 basically tells us the distance from the bot to the closes mine of the bot. It also finds mines that are close to the bot. Lines 67-75 is This is for when the bot needs to go to a tavern to get health, it finds the closest tavern to get health from. Lines 78-88 is This is the command that is used to attack other bots. The longer the bot is around the other bot, the more damage it will take. Lines 92-96 is talking about how if the bot isn't attacking other bots, finding mines, or taverns this allows the bot to roam around the area.  </font></h2>
