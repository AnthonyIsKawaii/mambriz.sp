<h2><font color="white"><p>These two images are the code required to create the final result above. The image on the left is the HTML used to display it on the webpage. As you can see in between the center tags there is a line of code that says input I.D. and what that means is that it gives the program to change Background color. The button I.D. is what creates a button and allows to be pressed. The "script src" line is what runs the javascript to make this happen!  </p></h2></font>

<h2><font color="white"><p>The right image is the javascript that was used to run the changebar. The second line of code is what creats an I.D to make the Background change color, and the third line of code is what gives its task to change background color. Line 7-8 is what sets the body background color that the user desires.    </p></h2></font>
